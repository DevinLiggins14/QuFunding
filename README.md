## 🧠 What is QuFunding?

**QuFunding** is a fully on-chain, decentralized crowdfunding platform built with **C++** as a smart contract on the **Qubic network**. It empowers creators and innovators to raise capital for their projects in a **trustless**, **transparent**, and **automated** way.

> 💡 More than just crowdfunding — it’s a **tokenized DAO** with **built-in deflationary economics** and **dividend payouts**.

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

QuFunding operates as a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** and features an **Initial Platform Offering (IPO)**. Early supporters can buy shares and earn:

- **Dividends** from platform fees 💰
- **Deflationary gains** from automatic share burns 🔥

This creates a self-sustaining economy that rewards participation and long-term support.
